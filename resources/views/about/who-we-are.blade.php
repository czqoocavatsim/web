                The Gander Oceanic OCA has been committed to providing the best oceanic control available on the VATSIM network for years. Supported by VATCAN and the Americas region, our team is dedicated to providing quality instruction of non-radar surveillance procedures and phraseology, supporting our incredible community of talented controllers and providing resources for pilots so that everybody can experience the best that the world of oceanic flight has to offer. We are proud to operate a full ADS-B simulation, supported by our Oceanic EuroScope plugin, the Virtual North Atlantic Airspace Situation Tracker (vNAAATS).

                Since 2017, the Gander Oceanic OCA has undergone a major revitalisation, with the development of a brand new website, a new controller package and plugin and an increased focus on the quality of our training program and associated resources. Our procedures are constantly being reviewed and our tools are regularly updated based on the amazing feedback from our community. We aim to provide the coolest, calmest and most collected service to pilots flying over the North Atlantic, and we're glad that you're interested in how it all works!
